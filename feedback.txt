Make a new file for each of your classes
Constructors should avoid altering the information given to them by removing things and should instead throw an exception if data is invalid.
Avoid throwing exceptions that will already be thrown for you (null cards would get their exception from addCard)
Don't limit your object by placing restrictions on it that don't break your code.  Someone may want to use empty strings, null values or negatives for names/suits/values etc.
Reuse your methods (addCard) to reduce code and create a more streamlined version.  Would also reduce number of exceptions.
Avoid using methods that are not backwards compatible (isBlank vs isEmpty).  Can be good but can also be bad to use the latest thing!
Otherwise great work!
